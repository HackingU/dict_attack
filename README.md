# What is a dictionary attack?
  A dictionary attack is an password attempt using a dictionary that contains standard passwords, logins or both.
  It uses requests on an HTTP to check if the password in the wordlist matches with the user password by a GET request.



Keep in mind that this particular script only works when it uses an HTTP request.
